# Project Description

Your project aims to develop a comprehensive medical system that enables doctors to efficiently manage patient records digitally. The system leverages modern technologies such as **QR Codes** and **fingerprint identification** to provide quick and secure access to medical information during emergencies. 

It allows doctors to input and update patient data while sharing their medical history with hospitals or emergency response teams. This project enhances the speed of medical response and diagnostic accuracy, particularly for critical conditions such as heart disease, diabetes, and cancer.
